# StarGen

## Welcome to StarGen

**Stargen** is a a random solar system generator, derived from the work of a
great number of people over the past three dozen years. (See [Credits](credits.md)
for details). It's falled **StarGen** because there are already enough
versions that call themselves *starform* to be confusing.

It can be use for [Celestia](https://www.celestia.org/), space games, etc.

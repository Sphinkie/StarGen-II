# StarGen II

## Source files

The library source files are in the **/lib** folder. The **main.ccp** file is an example file that shows how to use the StarGen-II library.

It uses a random seed, and generates an XML and an HTML *output files* for the same solar system. 

If you just need the executable program, you can get it in the **Releases** section of the root repository.

If you need the library for your own program, you just need to use the **/lib** subfolder.

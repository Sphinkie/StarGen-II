\section{Welcome to Star\-Gen}\label{index_intro}
{\bf Stargen} is a a random solar system generator, derived from the work of a great number of people over the past three dozen years. (See {\bf Credits.txt}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{_credits_8txt})} for details). It's falled {\bf Star\-Gen} because there are already enough versions that call themselves {\em starform\/} to be confusing.\par
 It can be use for Celestia, space games, etc.\section{Contact}\label{index_contact}

# StarGen-II

*StarGen* creates datasheets for realistic solar systems. It is used for developing space simulation games.

## Original StarGen

The original *StarGen* code is developed by Jim Burrows in *Visual C* and can be found at [eldacur.com](https://eldacur.com/~brons/NerdCorner/StarGen/StarGen.html).

## StarGen 2

Rewritten in C++, *StarGen-II* offers a set of classes that can be used to define the characteristics of a solar system, during the runtime of your application, or before with the *command line* program.

The program generates an XML file, describing a solar system.
The Library returns a dataset to the caller with the same information.

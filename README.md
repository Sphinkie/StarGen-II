# StarGen II

**StarGen** creates datasheets for realistic solar systems. 

It is used for developing space simulation games. It is a a random solar system generator, derived from the work of a great number of people over the past three dozen years. It can be use for [Celestia](https://celestia.fr), space games, etc.

## Original StarGen

The original *StarGen* code is developed by *Jim Burrows* in *Visual C* and can be found at [eldacur.com](https://eldacur.com/~brons/NerdCorner/StarGen/StarGen.hmtl). A GitHub repository is available [here](https://github.com/grahamreeds/StarGen).

## StarGen 2

Rewritten in C++, *StarGen-II* offers a set of classes that can be used to define the characteristics of solar systems, during the runtime of your application, or in advance using the *command line* program.

The program generate an XML file (or a plain TXT), describing a solar system.

All technical information about how the library works can be found in the [doxygen documentation](https://sphinkie.github.io/StarGen-II/doxygen/html/index.html).
